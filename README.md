## DESCRIPTION:

Application framework for state based session management. See lib/sbsm.rb

## FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Open problems
** There is no real integration test using rack-test to prove that a minimal app is working
** Handling redirects is not tested (and probably will not work)
** Handling passthru is not tested (and probably will not work)
** I get often the error `Errno::EACCES at / Permission denied @ rb_sysopen - /tmp/sbsm_lock`. Reloading the page once or twices fixes the problem.
